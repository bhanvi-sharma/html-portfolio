<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Bhanvi, content writer and tech enthusiast who's interested in expanding my knowledge in Web Development and AI.
  I have worked as a content writing intern for the past few months, and my work has included everything from buying guides to how-to guides to academic content.
</p>

<p>I was responsible for creating SEO-friendly content to help readers get what they need from the content. I love working on projects that help people understand things more easily - especially when it comes to finding information online. Also, I found content writing as a suitable way for me to learn about different things and express that knowledge with writing.</p>

<p>I'm interested in tech and have started my journey with learning web development with the course offered by London Appbrewery on Udemy. My goal is to be a confident web developer who can build websites and give layout to imaginations. </p>
