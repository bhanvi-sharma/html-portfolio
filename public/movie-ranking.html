<h1>The Best Movies According to Bhanvi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>This is a Bollywood movie about the mental pressure faced by engineering students in top-tier colleges. The story revolves around three friends who have different interest and one of them is a keen learner chasing excellence rather than success. For me is a go-to movie every time.</p>
<h3>Anand</h3>
<p>This is movies starring late Rajesh Khanna sir. The reason I love this movie is that it teaches that life should be big not long and every moment is worth enjoying with every person you encounter be it stangers or loved ones.</p>
<h3>2012</h3>
<p>I love this movie for the thrill it has to offer.</p>
